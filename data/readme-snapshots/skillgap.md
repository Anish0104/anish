- A [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) API Key for Gemini API

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anish0104/skillgap.git
   cd skillgap
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following keys:
